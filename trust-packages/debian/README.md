# `cert-manager-package-debian` Trust Package

For details on what trust packages are, see the [trust-packages README](../README.md).

This trust package uses a Debian container to retrieve its trust package. Debian was chosen
to be the first source for trust packages as it's also used as the base for the [distroless base images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
which are used in the cert-manager project.

Therefore, by using Debian again here, we're not adding any new entities we need to trust, since we already trust
Debian extensively elsewhere.

This package is used for both Debian Bookworm and Debian Bullseye
